# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS: unexpected style overriding due to specificity rules.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution using more specific selectors or the `!important` flag (used cautiously).

The problem arises from the interaction between different selectors and their precedence. Understanding CSS specificity is key to avoiding these types of bugs.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering selector specificity when writing CSS.
