The CSS specificity rules can be confusing and lead to unexpected styling issues. For example, consider the following code:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This will override the color of the paragraph inside the div */
}
```

In this case, the `div p` selector is more specific than the `div` or `p` selectors, so it overrides their styles. This can be difficult to debug if you're not familiar with CSS specificity.
