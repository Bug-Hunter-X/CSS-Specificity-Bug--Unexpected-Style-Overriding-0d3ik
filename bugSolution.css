Several solutions exist to address this CSS specificity issue:

**1. More Specific Selectors:**  Instead of relying on general selectors, use more specific ones to target the element you want to style precisely. For example, if you only want to style paragraphs within a specific div with a particular ID, you might use:

```css
#myDiv p {
  color: green;
}
```

**2. `!important` Flag (Use Cautiously):** The `!important` flag forces a style rule to override any other rules. However, overuse can make your CSS difficult to maintain. Use this sparingly.

```css
div p {
  color: green !important;
}
```

The best approach is generally to refactor your CSS to use more specific selectors rather than relying on `!important`.
